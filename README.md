Code base for analysis of product manifolds using diffusion maps

Spring 2020 junior independent work project under the Princeton University Department of Mathematics


example_params.json -- example of a json file for toggling inputs to the algorithm/tests

generate_data.py -- generates randomly sampled data from a selection of toy manifolds, and runs the algorithm to output two separate manifolds of eigenvectors

generate_plots.py -- generates plots from the results created by generate_data.py
