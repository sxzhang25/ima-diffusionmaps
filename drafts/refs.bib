	abstract = {Single-particle electron cryomicroscopy is an essential tool for high-resolution 3D reconstruction of proteins and other biological macromolecules. An important challenge in cryo-EM is the reconstruction of non-rigid molecules with parts that move and deform. Traditional reconstruction methods fail in these cases, resulting in smeared reconstructions of the moving parts. This poses a major obstacle for structural biologists, who need high-resolution reconstructions of entire macromolecules, moving parts included. To address this challenge, we present a new method for the reconstruction of macromolecules exhibiting continuous heterogeneity. The proposed method uses projection images from multiple viewing directions to construct a graph Laplacian through which the manifold of three-dimensional conformations is analyzed. The 3D molecular structures are then expanded in a basis of Laplacian eigenvectors, using a novel generalized tomographic reconstruction algorithm to compute the expansion coefficients. These coefficients, which we name spectral volumes, provide a high-resolution visualization of the molecular dynamics. We provide a theoretical analysis and evaluate the method empirically on several simulated data sets.}

    abstract = { Single-particle electron cryomicroscopy (cryo-EM) is an increasingly popular technique for elucidating the three-dimensional (3D) structure of proteins and other biologically significant complexes at near-atomic resolution. It is an imaging method that does not require crystallization and can capture molecules in their native states. In single-particle cryo-EM, the 3D molecular structure needs to be determined from many noisy 2D tomographic projections of individual molecules, whose orientations and positions are unknown. The high level of noise and the unknown pose parameters are two key elements that make reconstruction a challenging computational problem. Even more challenging is the inference of structural variability and flexible motions when the individual molecules being imaged are in different conformational states. This review discusses computational methods for structure determination by single-particle cryo-EM and their guiding principles from statistical inference, machine learning, and signal processing, which also play a significant role in many other data science applications. Expected final online publication date for the Annual Review of Biomedical Data Science, Volume 3 is July 20, 2020.
